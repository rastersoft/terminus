# Terminus #

**IMPORTANT: Terminus has been migrated to Gitlab**

A new terminal for XWindows (and Wayland)

## What is it ##

There are plenty of graphic terminals for linux, so what makes this one different?

First, it allows to split a window in several tiling subwindows, exactly like the old
Terminator terminal. Of course it can create several simultaneous windows, and allows
to have several tabs in each window.

Second, allows to have an always-available drop-down terminal in all screens, with an
appearance similar to the Quake console, exactly like Guake.

Of course, the Guake-like terminal can be split in tiling subwindows, wich is its main
novelty.

Third, it has been written in Vala and uses Gtk3, which allows it to take advantage
of the new characteristics available and to use less resources (both guake and terminator
are written in python 2, which needs more memory, and uses Gtk2, which can be considered
obsolete).

## Compiling it ##

Just follow the classic cmake instructions:

    mkdir install
    cd install
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

If, during cmake stage, you receive an error for missing libraries, install them,
delete all the contents inside *install*, and run cmake again. Launching cmake
in a folder with parts of a previously failed cmake run can result in build errors
(don't ask why).

If your system has an old Gtk version (like Ubuntu yakkety yak, which has Gtk 3.20),
you would need to define GTK_3_20 to use some old functions, not available in versions
older than Gtk 3.22. You can do it this way:

    mkdir install
    cd install
    cmake .. -DGTK_3_20=on
    make
    sudo make install

## Using it ##

By default, using Shift+F12 will show the Quake-like terminal, but you can change
the key binding by pressing right-click and selecting "Properties".

By default, terminus is launched during startup to check if the user wants to have
the Quake-like terminal available, so just installing it and rebooting will guarantee
to have it. You can also launch it from a terminal.

Currently the number of options modificable is small, but more will become available.

## Creating new palettes ##

It is very easy to add new palettes to Terminus. Just edit a file with *.color_scheme*
as extension, and place it at */usr/share/terminus* (or */usr/local/share/terminus*,
depending where you installed the binaries) to have it globally available, or at
*~/.local/share/terminus* to make it available only to you.

The format is very simple. Here is an example that defines a foreground/background
color scheme:

    name: Orange on black
    name[es]: Naranja sobre negro
    text_fg: #FECE12
    text_bg: #000000

This file will define the *Orange on black* color scheme, that specifies that the
foreground will be orange, and the background will be black. It also specifies the name
translated into spanish.

Another example, this time for a palette scheme:

    name: Solarized
    palette: #002b36
    palette: #073642
    palette: #586e75
    palette: #657b83
    palette: #839496
    palette: #93a1a1
    palette: #eee8d5
    palette: #fdf6e3
    palette: #b58900
    palette: #cb4b16
    palette: #dc322f
    palette: #d33682
    palette: #6c71c4
    palette: #268bd2
    palette: #2aa198
    palette: #859900

This one defines the *Solarized* palette, with all its 16 colors. Each *palette*
entry defines one color, and they will be inserted in that precise order. There
must be exactly 16 *palette* entries; no more, no less.

You can define in a single file a color scheme and a palette scheme, but they will
be shown in the app as separated elements. This is: if you define in a single file
a color and palette scheme called MYGREATFULLSCHEME, you will find a color scheme
called MYGREATFULLSCHEME in the color scheme list, and it will change only the
foreground/background colors; and you also will find a palette scheme called
MYGREATFULLSCHEME in the palette scheme list, and it will change only the palette
itself, but not the foreground/background colors.

## FAQ ##

**Q:** I use Gnome-Shell and when I show the Quake terminal, it doesn't get the focus.  
**A:** It seems that installing the "Steal my focus" extension fix it. It can be found at
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/234/steal-my-focus/

**Q:** I'm using Wayland, and pressing Alt+F12 (or my keybinding) doesn't show the Quake-like
terminal.  
**A:** That's because Wayland doesn't allow to an application to set its own keybindings.
Fortunately, Terminus includes a Gnome Shell extension that allows to show the Quake-like
terminal. If you have installed Terminus, just exit your session, enter again, and enable
the extension with gnome-tweak-tool.

Another way is using the desktop keybindings to launch the script "terminus_showhide",
which makes use of the DBus remote control to show and hide the Quake-like terminal.

In Gnome Shell it is as easy as opening the Settings window, choose the "Keyboard" icon,
and add there the desired hotkey, associating it with "terminus_showhide" program.

**Q:** I translated Terminus, but the color and palette schemes aren't translated. Why?  
**A:** You have to also translate the ".color_scheme" files located at data/local.
